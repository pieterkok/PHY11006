    "\n",
    "Newton's second law says that $F=ma$: the force $F$ on a body with mass $m$ causes an acceleration $a$ of that body. We will explore how this law allows us to describe a range of motion, but in order to do that systematically, we have to introduce the mathematical notions of position, velocity, and acceleration. Afterwards, we will link $F$ to the forces we discussed in the first lecture.\n",

    "This means that the velocity is the *rate of change* of position, and the acceleration is the *rate of change* of velocity. At any point in time the particle may be completely described by its position, its velocity, and the energy potential it moves in.  Given a particular potential, when we know the position of a particle *and* its velocity at time $t$, we will know where the particle will be at time $t+\\d t$, namely\n",

Also note the change in integration variable $t'$ to distinguish it from the integration limit $t$. You should verify that when you calculate the time derivatives of $x(t)$ and $v(t)$ in these integral forms, you retrieve $v(t)$ and $a(t)$.\n",

Newton's second law tells us that $F = ma$, and for conservative forces we established that the force is equal to the space derivative of a potential $V$. If we write the acceleration as the second time derivative of position, we have the general relation\n",

Using Newton's second law, we find that $F = ma = 0$, which means that the acceleration $a$ is equal to zero (we are not considering massless particles in this course). Qualitatively, you know what it means for a particle to have zero acceleration: it has a constant velocity. However, in preparation for the more involved examples, we will see how we treat this mathematically. In order to find the velocity of a particle, we have to integrate the acceleration over time. From equation {eq}`hegrw40uoerijfd` we find\n",

    "\n",
    "We can go further and integrate the velocity to get the position as a function of time using equation {eq}`hegrw40uoerijfd` again:\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Often we use the special value $t_0 = 0$, and the constants $x(t_0)$ and $v(t_0)$ are given the special symbols $x_0$ and $v_0$, respectively. With these substitutions, we obtain the very familiar result\n",

    "---\n",

    "As soon as a force acts on our particle, it no longer moves uniformly, that is, with constant velocity. Let's consider the next simplest case, where a constant force is acting on our particle: $F = k$, where $k$ is a constant. Again, we use Newton's second law to write $F = ma = k$ and integrate twice to find the velocity and the position of the particle, using equation {eq}`hegrw40uoerijfd`:\n",

The position $x(t)$ in equation {eq}`lnhueru4erohidf` is not just a single equation, but rather a *family* of equations: we can choose any value of $x_0$ and $v_0$, and the given acceleration $a_0$ then determines the path of the particle for all times.

It is also an oversimplified problem, because by considering only $r$, we restricted ourselves to a one-dimensional problem.

However, for the $1/r$ potential, objects will be moving in orbits, which is motion in a *plane*, requiring at least two coordinates. In the next lecture we will explore the position, velocity and acceleration of particles as vectors, and develop the mathematics needed to describe motion in two and three dimensions. Even then, the problem of orbital motion is still far from trivial. But we can solve it in the sense that we will derive Kepler's three laws of orbital motion from the inverse-square force law. In order to achieve this, we will introduce a variety of concepts and conservation laws that form the backbone of not only mechanics, but also quantum mechanics, relativity and atomic physics.\n"
