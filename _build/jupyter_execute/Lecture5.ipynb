    "### Conservation of energy\n",
    "\n",
    "In the problem set of lecture 1 we saw that the work $W$ done on an object by a conservative force $F$ along a (one-dimensional) path is given by \n",

    " W = \\int_{x_0}^{x_1} F \\, \\d x = - \\int_{x_0}^{x_1} \\frac{\\d V}{\\d x} \\, \\d x = V(x_0) - V(x_1)\\, .\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Using Newton's second law, $F = \\d p/\\d t$, we can relate the potential change between two positions to the change in momentum:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    " V(x) - V(x_0) & = - \\int_{x_0}^x \\frac{\\d p}{\\d t} \\d x = - \\int_{p(x_0)}^{p(x)} v\\, \\d p = - \\int_{p(x_0)}^{p(x)} \\frac{p}{m}\\, \\d p = - \\left[ \\frac{p^2}{2m}\\right]_{p(x_0)}^{p(x)} \\cr\n",
    " & = -\\left(\\frac{p(x)^2}{2m} - \\frac{p(x_0)^2}{2m}\\right)\\, .\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "You will recognise the right-hand side in the last line as the change of kinetic energy $T$ of the object, and this means that without any further effects on the object, the potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy. As the potential energy decreases, or $V(x) < V(x_0)$, the kinetic energy increases and vice versa. Bringing everything to the left-had side of the equation, we end up with an expression for the conservation of energy:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    " \\Delta V + \\Delta T = 0\\, ,\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where we denote changes by the greek letter $\\Delta$ (pronounced \"delta\"). Note that this is a statement about *changes*. We can roll a marble down a ramp in the basement or in the penthouse (assuming constant $g$), and we will get the same results for the change in kinetic energy even though the potential energy of the marble in the penthouse is much greater than in the basement. Conservation of energy applies to the changes in energy in a process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a special case of a broader conservation principle: the total energy in a closed system is conserved. It doesn't mean that energy is always in a useful form. For example, when a friction force slows down a block sliding down a ramp, the final velocity is lower than if all potential energy was converted into kinetic energy. The `missing' energy has become the heat generated by the friction between the block and the ramp. It is typically not possible to recover this form of energy, but when we take it into account the total energy in the system is conserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with energy conservation in practical problems, we often compare the initial state of our physical system to its final state and do some simple book keeping. In the example above, the energy of the initial state, with the block at rest atop the ramp at height $h$, is \n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    " E_{\\rm before} = mgh\\, ,\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $m$ is the mass of the block. The energy of the final state, at the bottom of the ramp, is\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    " E_{\\rm after} = \\frac12 m v^2 + Q\\, ,\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $v$ is the final speed of the block and $Q$ is the heat generated by the friction. When there is no friction, we can calculate $v$ from $h$. If there is friction, we can determine the heat it generates by measuring $v$ and using energy conservation: $E_{\\rm after} = E_{\\rm before}$, or \n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    " Q = mgh - \\frac12 m v^2\\, .\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "We will use this method when we discuss collisions a bit later on. It will be critical to determine whether there is any heat generated in a collision, so you can tell whether you can use energy conservation for the particles that are colliding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Momentum conservation\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important law of physics is the conservation of momentum: for any system that does not experience a net external force, its momentum is conserved. For a single particle this is simply Newton's second law:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    " \\F = 0 \\quad \\to\\quad \\frac{\\d\\p}{\\d t} = 0\\, .\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "However, we saw that this law also holds for composite bodies consisting of $N$ components with mass $m_j$, centre of mass coordinate $\\R$, and centre of mass momentum $\\P$:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    " \\F_{\\rm ext} = 0 \\quad \\to\\quad \\frac{\\d\\P}{\\d t} = 0\\, .\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "One example is a supernova (we ignore the external gravitational force on the star towards the centre of the galaxy). In the rest frame of the star before the explosion, the momentum is $\\P=0$ since the velocity of the centre of mass $\\V$ is zero. That does not mean all the parts of the star are at rest. Far from it! But all these small momenta sum up to zero:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    " \\P_{\\rm before} = \\p_1 + \\p_2 + \\cdots + \\p_N = \\sum_{j=0}^N \\p_j = 0\\, ,\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $N$ is *very* large. After the explosion, all the parts have been blown away, so the momentum of the individual parts may be much larger than before: $\\p_j' > \\p_j$, but taken together, they still sum up to the same total momentum as before:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    " \\P_{\\rm after} = \\p_1' + \\p_2' + \\cdots + \\p_M' = \\sum_{j=0}^M \\p_j' = 0\\, .\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "We may no longer have the same number of parts in the system after the explosion, so $M\\neq N$ in general. Since this is a closed system, the energy is conserved as well, and the increased velocities of the constituent parts must come from somewhere. In a supernova, there is a lot of potential energy stored away in the atomic nuclei. When these nuclei fuse in a supernova explosion, this energy gets released and is turned into momentum. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also important situations where momentum is not conserved. For example, a ball bouncing off a wall changes its momentum: right before the bounce it was moving, say, to the right with $\\p_{\\rm before} = m\\v$, and immediately after the bounce it is moving to the left with $\\p_{\\rm after} = -m\\v$. The wall exerted a force on the ball that turned it around. The overall impulse $\\S$ that turned the ball around is \n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    " \\S = \\p_{\\rm after} - \\p_{\\rm before} = \\F_{\\rm wall} \\Delta t\\, ,\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $\\Delta t$ is the time of contact between the ball and the wall, and $\\F_{\\rm wall}$ is the force exerted by the wall on the ball. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we consider the ball and the wall together (assuming that there is no other system present, no Earth, no child throwing the ball), then momentum will be conserved, because we also have to consider the force of the ball exerted on the wall—Newton's third law—and the total net force on the combined system is zero. The total momentum before the bounce is $\\p_{\\rm before} = m\\v$, with the velocity of the wall before the bounce  zero. After the bounce, the momentum is \n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  \\p_{\\rm after} = -m\\v + M\\v_{\\rm w}\\, ,\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $M$ is the mass of the wall and $\\v_{\\rm w}$ is the velocity of the wall after the bounce. $M$ is typically much larger than the mass of the ball $m$. Momentum conservation $\\p_{\\rm after} = \\p_{\\rm before}$ means that the velocity of the wall becomes\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  -m\\v + M\\v_{\\rm w} = m\\v\\, , \\qquad\\to\\qquad \\v_{\\rm w} = \\frac{2m}{M} \\v\\, ,\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "which is tiny compared to $\\v$ when $M\\gg m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collisions\n",
    "\n",
    "The ball bouncing against a wall is a simple example of a collision problem. In this section we will develop the theory of collisions in more detail and for more general problems. We have to distinguish between two types of collisions, elastic and inelastic. Elastic collisions obey both energy and momentum conservation; the total kinetic energy before and after the collision remains unchanged. Inelastic collisions involve a change in kinetic energy, so that \n",

    "  T_{\\rm before} = T_{\\rm after} + Q\\, . \n",
    "```\n",
    "Typically $Q$ is a positive quantity, for example when some of the kinetic energy in the collision is converted to heat. However, $Q$ can also be negative when the collision triggers a release of potential energy (as in the supernova explosion). For example, a ship colliding with a sea mine triggers a detonation that creates a lot more kinetic energy than the kinetic energy that went into the collision. This is sometimes called a *super-elastic* collision. Finally, when $Q=0$ the collision is elastic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a simple elastic collision of a particle with mass $m_1$ with another particle of mass $m_2$. Furthermore, we assume that $m_1$ has an initial velocity of $\\v_1$, and $m_2$ is at rest at the origin. We consider this a two-dimensional problem, so the collision will take place entirely in the $xy$-plane. Since the collision is elastic, both the momentum and the kinetic energy is conserved:\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where we used $\\u_1$ and $\\u_2$ for the velocities of $m_1$ and $m_2$ after the collision. To solve this, we want to work out the final velocities. However, we want to get rid of the vector quantities if we can, because they complicate things. We can write the term with $\\u_2$ in terms of $\\u_1$ and $\\v_1$:\n",
