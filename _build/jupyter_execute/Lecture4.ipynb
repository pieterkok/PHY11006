    "As an example, consider a mass $m$ on a frictionless ramp that is subject to a force $f$ preventing it from sliding down (see Fig. 5). Gravity produces a downward force $W$, the weight, and the ramp produces a normal force $N$ that prevents the mass from moving into the ramp. The normal force will always have exactly the magnitude to keep it on the ramp. We can choose our $x$ and $y$ coordinates any way we like, as long as they are perpendicular (orthogonal) to each other. In this problem it is convenient to take $x$ down the ramp, and $y$ perpendicular to the ramp. Since the mass is at rest, the three forces should balance, i.e., sum to zero:\n",

    "The normal force $N$ is due to Newton's third law, which states that a force on one body (the ramp) due to another (the mass) produces a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body (the mass) due to the other (the ramp).

    "\n",
    "Another important concept for vectors is the *point of engagement*, or the starting point of the arrow that represents the force. We treated the mass in figure 5 as a point mass, and all forces therefore engage at the centre of gravity. However, for extended systems this can be different. For example, while the weight force ($mg$) always has the centre of gravity as the point of engagement, the normal force has the boundary between the block and the ramp surface as the point of engagement. Any friction force also has the point of engagement lying in the contact surface between the block and the ramp. We will explore the importance of this when we consider torque in a future lecture.\n",

    "### Newton's third law\n",
    "In the example of the block on the ramp in the previous section, the two bodies exert a force on each other: the weight of the block is a force *on* the ramp, while the ramp exerts an equal and opposite force on the block, namely the normal force. This is a consequence of Newton's third law that forces *always* appear in pairs that are equal and opposite, but acting on different objects. Imagine that object 1 exerts a force $\\F_{12}$ on object 2. The point of engagement of $\\F_{12}$ is on object 2. The third law states that object 2 also exerts a force on object 1, $\\F_{21}$ that is opposite and equal in magnitude to $\\F_{12}$:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    " \\F_{21} = -\\F_{12}\\, .\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "The two objects do not need to be touching, as is the case with the block and the ramp. The gravitational force on the Earth by the Sun is a vector $\\F_{\\rm g}$ acting on the Earth and pointing towards the Sun. Similarly, the Earth exerts an equal force on the Sun in opposite direction, $-\\F_{\\rm g}$. The acceleration of the Earth $\\a_{\\rm E}$ due to the Sun's gravity can be written as \n",

    "Often we want to consider a system of $N$ masses $m_1$, $m_2$, $\\ldots$ $m_N$. This can be a galaxy of stars, the solar system, an atomic nucleus with orbiting electrons, or a formation of flying drones, to name a few examples. There may be forces between these objects. If there is a force $\\F_{jk}$ on mass $m_k$ due to mass $m_j$, then there is also a force $\\F_{kj} = -\\F_{jk}$ on mass $m_j$ due to mass $m_k$ due to Newton's third law. \n",
