    "As we have seen, the momentum $\\p$ of a body with mass $m$ is the amount of *linear* motion of the body. To change this amount of linear motion, we need to apply a force $\\F = \\d\\p/\\d t$. The situation changes somewhat when we consider *rotational* motion. We cannot merely apply a force to set a body in motion, we need a *moment*, or *torque* $\\vec{\\tau}$. You are already familiar with torque: a lever or see-saw has two forces (e.g., gravity at the end of the see-saw and the normal force at the fulcrum), in opposite direction and with a distance $d$ apart. You have been writing this as $\\tau = Fd$. Now we will give this expression its proper vector form (not least because in this form $Fd$ could be mistaken for work!).\n",

    "It is because of this conservation law that angular momentum is so important and ubiquitous in physics. The orbital motion of electrons in atoms is classified by energy and angular momentum, and the entire periodic table is a direct consequence of the allowed energy and angular momentum values of the electrons. Rotating black holes have angular momentum, and this creates interesting frame dragging effects near their horizons. Gyroscopes keep their orientation in space because of conservation of angular momentum, and this allows for navigation at sea in the absence of external signals (such as the position of the stars on cloudy nights). These are just a few examples of the central importance of angular momentum in physics. You will keep encountering this topic throughout your studies. \n",
